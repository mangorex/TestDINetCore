It is about a development in C# testing Dependency Injection in console application with .NET 5

### Architecture and technologies used
* **Windows 10**
* **Net core 5**
* Visual studio 2019 community Edition

### Nuggets to install
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.CommandLine
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables 
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

### Points completed
* **Code in english with so love and not so bad style of code (I think)**
* Basic implementation of Dependency Injection
* Simulations of methods of create customer and update customer. Of course, the real implementation
  of these methods are not real, it is only a test of Dependency Injection
    
### Things to improve:
* **Code with the best style of code (I think)**
* Creation and Update real implementation methods to Update customer in Database
* Doing more implementation with DI
* Simulating a business logic more complex
*  **many thanks to the people** who have given me the test **to prove myself**
